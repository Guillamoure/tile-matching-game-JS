# Tile Matching Game

Using vanilla JavaScript, I built a memory card game in four days with a partner at Flatiron School. This game flashes images for a limited amount of time and requires the player to memorize the images that flashed. The game contains a timer and a leader board. You make it to the leader board if you complete the game in record timing.
