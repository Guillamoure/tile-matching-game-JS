Tile Matching Game

Using vanilla JavaScript, I built a memory card game in four days with a partner at Flatiron School. This game flashes images for a limited amount of time and requires the player to memorize the images that flashed. The game contains a timer and a leader board. You make it to the leader board if you complete the game in record timing. 

Getting Started 
Clone github repo in terminal and open up in your favorite text editor. Make sure you have Rails installed because the backend if fully Rails and you will need it in order to access the database!


Prerequisites

In the project directory, you can run:
rails s (for the backend)


npm start(for the front-end)
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
